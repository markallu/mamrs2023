<h3> Scope </h3>
    <ul>
<p>
Multi- Agent Systems (MAS) has rapidly emerged as an integral sub-field of Artificial Intelligence and has presented new and exciting challenges to the community of networking and communications researchers. 
Within a Multi Agent System, several decision making agents interact within a shared environments towards a common, or conflicting goal.<br>
 
Multi- Robot Systems (MRS) are a subset of MAS with physical embodiment that presents a unique set of challenges and applications. Fundamentally, the cooperation required of both MAS and MRS in achieving their objectives
 places arduous demands of the networking infrastructure, and seeks novel communication solutions. <br>

 This workshop aims to congeal about the community interested in MAS and MRS especially as concerned to communication and coordination challenges. It intends to facilitate discussions about contemporary problems and solutions,
  towards defining standardized scientific methods and practices for the design, development and validation of algorithms and strategies in these domains.

<h3> Instructions for Authors </h3>
 <ul>Submitted manuscripts must be formatted in standard IEEE camera-ready conference format and must be submitted via Easychair (https://easychair.org/) as PDF files (formatted for 8.5x11-inch paper). The manuscripts should be no longer than 7 pages. No extra pages will be allowed. Submitted papers cannot have been previously published in or be under consideration for publication in another journal or conference. The workshop Program Committee reserves the right to not review papers that either exceed the length specification or have been submitted or published elsewhere. Submissions must include a title, abstract, keywords, author(s), and affiliation(s) with postal and e-mail address(es).
</ul>


<h3> Review and Publication of Manuscripts </h3>
 <ul>Submitted papers will be reviewed by the workshop Program Committee and judged on originality, technical correctness, relevance, and quality of presentation. An accepted paper must be presented at the ICCCN 2023 venue by one of the authors registered at the full registration rate. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the ICCCN proceedings and submitted to Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases. 
</ul>

<h3> Submission Terms and Conditions </h3>
<ul><li>Authors understood that the submission is original and has not been submitted to other venue or under consideration by other venues. </ul>

<ul><li>Paper titles and/or author names cannot be changed and/or added to the papers once papers are submitted to ICCCN 2023 for review (and in the final camera-ready manuscript if accepted).</ul>
 
 
<ul><li>If the paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must register/pay at full rate and present it in person at the conference. Please check ICCCN conference site for more publication requirements. </ul>
